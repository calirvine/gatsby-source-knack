# gatsby-source-knack
Creating a gatsby source plugin for knack database.

## Complete
Basic configuration complete pulling in all data and adding it to the graphql schema

## TODO
1. Create a way to map generic field names to named fields for a better developer experience (i.e field_1 renamed title etc)
2. Write a proper readme
3. Add ability to connect to authenticated views
4. Maybe create a way to connect multiple views and do joins on data?
